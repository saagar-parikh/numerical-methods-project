# Numerical simulations and stability analysis of a COVID-19 model using fractional derivatives

This project numerically simulates a fractional-order COVID-19 model based on the Khan-Atangana model. The numerical method used to solve the equations is called the Grunwald-Letnikov derivative. The simulation predicts the behaviour of different subgroups of the population like susceptible, exposed, infected, asymptomatic and recovered people. The project also performs the stability analysis of this model at various equilibrium points.
